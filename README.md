# HL7Splitter

Specify an input file of HL7, a file to output, a segment, a field, and a value. The program will create a new file of all HL7 messages that contain that specified value in that field

Copy and paste into an IDE (will probably have to add a package property) or call javac /filepath/HL7Splitter.java and then call from CLI
